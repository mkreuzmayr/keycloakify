# üèÅ Requirements

{% hint style="success" %}
This tool will be maintained to stay compatible with every Keycloak version starting from [Keycloak Version 11](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/tag/11.0.3).

However, the default pages you will get (before you customize them) will always be the ones of Keycloak [v11.0.3](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/tag/11.0.3) and some extra pages that didn't existed back then like `register-user-profile.ftl.` &#x20;

Latest release isn't in the list yet? It probably works fine, we just can't confirm it yet. &#x20;

Older version are likely to be supported as well.&#x20;

### Supported meta framworks

Only create-react-app projects (and by extension any app that builds with Webpack) are supported.

Next.js and Vite aren't supported, they could be (Next only in build static mode) but it would require extra work.

This tool assumes you are bundling your app with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).&#x20;

It assumes there is a `build/` directory at the root of your react project directory, it's usually generated after running `yarn build`.

The `build/` directory is expected to contain an `index.html` file and a `build/static/` directory. &#x20;

Keycloakify also assumes there is a public/ directory at the root of your react project that is used to make static files available. &#x20;

Concretely Keycloakify assumes that if there is a `public/a/b.c/foo.txt` file. This file should be available at `https://localhost:<some_port>/a/b/c.foo.txt` when running your app in test mode (usually by firing yarn start).&#x20;

For more detailed information see [this issue](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/issues/5#issuecomment-832296432).

#### My framework isn't supported

It doesn‚Äôt mean that you can't use Keycloakify but your Keycloak theme will need to be a standalone project.\
Find specific instructions about how to get started [**here**](https://github.com/codegouvfr/keycloakify-starter#standalone-keycloak-theme).

To share your styles between your main app and your login pages you will need to externalize your design system by making it a separate module. Checkout [ts-ci](https://github.com/garronej/ts\_ci), it can help with that (example with [our design system](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui)).

### Utility that needs to be installed

* `docker` must be up and running when running `start_keycloak_testing_container.sh`&#x20;
